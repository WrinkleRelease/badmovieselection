This is a simplified version of the Bad Movie Wheel plug-in I still haven't been able to write for Kodi yet.

This plugin skips the spinning wheel graphic and displays a random bad movie for you to watch, accompanied with a sad sound effect. The script searches your movie database for `unwatched` movies containing the tag `Bad Movies` and chooses one at random.
